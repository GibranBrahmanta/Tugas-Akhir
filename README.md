An extractive Text Summarization model for Indonesian Text based on [Text summarization using topic-based vector space model and
semantic measure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306457321000443) paper 

On the original paper, WordNET was used to compute the semantic similarity between word. In this model, WordNET are being replaced by Vector Space Model and Similarity Measure because there weren't any WordNET model for Indonesian language.
